# User Registration API
  
## Overview  
This API was develop as a training. It aims to be a simple user registration with admin privileges and with memory storage.

This was proposed at Rocketseat's Ignite Bootcamp.

## Instalation & Running
I'm using **nodejs** and **yarn**, but you can run with **npm** as well
just run:
```shell
yarn
```
or:
```shell
npm install
```

then to run the server
```shell
yarn dev
```

server will be listening on port 3333, make sure it is available or change it on src/server.js.
